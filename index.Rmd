This workshop the second workshop designed for the Cancer MSc Students in UCL Cancer Institute to gain some confidence on using *R* (statistical-) programming language in their MSc projects. I would appreciate if you participate in this pre-course [**survey**]() (once again) so that I know of your expectation from today's workshop.
